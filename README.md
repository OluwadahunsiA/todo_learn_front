## Todo list: project for learning frontend

Here you gonna improve your frontend skills. 
We begin from very simple and useless todo application, and we are gonna build a complex thing.

### Motivation

Almost all the courses outside internet don\`t give you a "real world" experience.
You write some apps from scratch or even just repeat the code by youtube video - it\`s not good experience.
Here we gonna fix that. 
You will get some code, and you have to deal with it. 
You will receive some instructions just a description of features/tasks you need to do and that\`s it.

**An important thing here**: you must learn to do what are you asking for. 
The lessons here have a good description, so basically it will be clear what do you need to do,
and one of your main goal here it\`s doing only what description asks. 
You must do a task good and precise and as fast as you can. 

So, main rule here would be: **do your tasks, don\`t try to fix code/types around you, just 
implement your features and don\`t make code worse**, this is it.

### What do you need to know before start

- TS - beginner level
- React - medium level

This app based on Next.js, but you don\`t need to know it, don\`t worry.

### Get started

- make a fork from this repo
- download the repo
- make `nvm use` command(install `nvm` in case you don`t have it)
- make `yarn` command(install `yarn` in case you don`t have it)

### Working process

For developing and solving challenges run `yarn dev` command,
it starts local a server with the app on 3000 port for you.

### How it works

The repo has `learning` dir, each dir inside indicates one lesson and inside lesson`s dir we have:
- `task.md` - file with description of your task
- `hints.md` - some valuable hints for you, you can use them during the lesson, or you can check them after you solved the task before submit you result. Also, contains a link to pull request with my solution.
- also, the repo has a branch with lesson`s name, and it contains my way to solving the task
- pay attention that each lesson has an order number, and I strongly recommend do it only in the right order. Especially considering that each lesson starts when previous ends.

So, the common way to learning:
- choose your lesson
- create a local branch in your repo(your fork of this repo)
- open `task.md` file and read you task
- completely understand what task require you to do
- write your code, do your best and create pull request to your `master` branch
- use `hints.md` file whatever you want, especially if you feel any difficulty
- go to a pull request from `hints.md` file, to compare your solution with mine
- my solution is just a reference, and it could help you with some problems you might have, but don\`t be worry if your and my solution are not identical
- next lessons rely on my version of solution, so if you have completely different code it could be better to make it as close as possible to mine version.
- finally, merge you branch into master branch of your repo
- you are ready to next lesson

### What if "I don`t get your solution"

If you don\`t understand a solution, or you have any questions, you always can create a github issue,
and I will answer your question.
