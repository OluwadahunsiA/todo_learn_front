## Todo list: project for learning frontend

Here you gonna improve your frontend skills.
We begin from very simple and useless todo application and build a cool thing
with a lot of features.

## What do you need to know

- TS - beginner level
- React - medium level

This app based on Next.js, but you don\`t need to know it, don\`t worry.

## Get started

- make a fork from this repo
- download the repo
- make `nvm use` command(install `nvm` in case you don`t have it)
- make `yarn` command(install `yarn` in case you don`t have it)

## Working process

For developing and solving challenges run `yarn dev` command,
it starts local a server with the app on 3000 port for you.

## How it works

The repo has `learning` dir, each dir inside indicates one lesson and inside lesson`s dir we have:
- `task.md` - file with description of your task
- `hints.md` - some valuable hints for you, you can use them during the lesson, or you can check them after you solved the task before submit you result.
- also, the repo has a branch with lesson`s name, and it contains my way to solving the task
- pay attention that each lesson has an order number, and I strongly recommend do it only in the right order. Especially considering that each lesson starts when previous ends.

So, the common way to learning:
- choose your lesson
- create a local branch in your repo(your fork of this repo)
- open `task.md` file and read you task
- completely understand what task require you to do
- write your code, do your best and create pull request to your `master` branch
- use `hints.md` file whatever you want, especially if you feel any difficulty
- get final check of your solution, make it "production ready"
- go to a branch of the lesson and compare my solutions to yours
- my solution is the best, so trust it and draw conclusions if you have some differences
- next lessons rely on my version of solution, so make it as similar as you be comfortable
- finally, merge you branch into master
- you are ready to next lesson

## What if "I don`t get your solution"

Of course, it was a joke about "the best solution", it\`s just my way, you will have yours, and if you understand mine, and you still think yours is good, it\`s completely fine.

But, if you don\`t understand a solution, or you have any questions, you always can create a github issue,
and I will answer your question.
