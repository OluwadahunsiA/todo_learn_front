// 1. Create local storage
// 2. Separate your state from data. For instance in the tag type, active should be a state not a data.
// 3. Do not store active inside local storage.
// 4. Treat your local storage like you would treat your db (read a bit about how to store data). Do not store "active " in your ls.
//5. use clsx for your classes where you have conditions.
